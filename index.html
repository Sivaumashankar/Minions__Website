    <p>Minions is a 2015 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Illumination Entertainment and distributed by Universal Pictures. It is the spin-off/prequel[a] and the third installment overall in the Despicable Me franchise. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda (in Balda's directorial debut), produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and written by Brian Lynch, the film stars the voices of Coffin as the Minions (including Kevin, Stuart, and Bob), Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan, Jennifer Saunders, and is narrated by Geoffrey Rush. The film focuses on the Minions as they search for their new master.</p>

    <h4>Dancing Minions</h4>

    <p>If those little yellow creatures from “Despicable Me” and its sequel drove you bananas, you’ll find no respite at “Minions,” the third chapter in the series. Gru and his adopted daughters are nowhere to be found, nor are Pharrell Williams’ catchy songs. Instead, Gru’s loyal sidekicks step into the spotlight, underscored by a '60s era, Beatles-heavy soundtrack that must have cost a fortune in rights. Guided (and voiced) by co-director Pierre Coffin, the minion species earns an origin story that begins in the primordial soup and ends 42 years B.G. (Before Gru). Since “Minions” removes the emotional anchors of this series, one might assume that it is a heartless cash grab perpetrated by the greedy folks at Universal. And your assumption would be wrong, because this movie isn’t heartless.</p>

    <h4>Minions as Airhosters</h4>
    <img src="./images/images1.jpeg "alt="malli debendhi ra konda" width="100%">
    <p>On their journey, this cute trio occasionally breaks into song, singing in that nonsense mix of Spanish, French, and God knows what else Coffin utters for them. (I understood some of their dialogue, which scared the hell out of me.) Their lack of an identifiable dialect may be one reason “Minions” will do gangbusters overseas. This is a film where dubbing of its main characters will prove unnecessary. This is also why, out of all the “Despicable Me” films, “Minions” is the most suited for the youngest of moviegoers.</p>

    <h4>Minions in Prison</h4>
    <img src="./images/alison-wang-mou0S7ViElQ-unsplash.jpg"alt="malli debendhi ra konda" width="100%">
    <p>The minion mission is to reach the 1968 Villain-Con conference, where they can hook up with eligible baddies. Their first stop is a gorgeously rendered New York City. From there, they hitch a ride to Orlando with a family of bank robbers led by Keaton and Alison Janney. They makes the most of their short screen time, bringing a lively delivery to their lines before the film executes a hilarious clothing sight gag. Keaton and Janney are a lot more fun than Scarlett Overkill, whose goal is also robbery but of a more royal variety.</p>
